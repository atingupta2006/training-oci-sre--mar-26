## 0. Deployment Assumptions

For this topic, we assume that **BharatMart e-commerce platform** has experienced incidents and requires postmortem culture.

**Assumed Context:**
* **Incidents** have occurred (simulated or real)
* **Observability** data available (metrics and logs)
* **Team culture** focused on learning and improvement

## 1. Concept Overview

**Postmortem culture** is the practice of learning from failures through structured analysis and improvement. It's fundamental to SRE because:

* **Every incident is a learning opportunity**
* **Blameless culture enables honest analysis**
* **Systematic improvement prevents recurrence**
* **Knowledge sharing builds team capability**

Key principles:

* **Blameless** - Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
* **Timely** - Conduct postmortems within 48 hours
* **Actionable** - Create specific, trackable action items
* **Shared** - Knowledge benefits entire team
